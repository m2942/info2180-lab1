        <h2>Dante Thames</h2>
        <p>Greetings. My name is Dante Thames, and I would like to tell you a bit about myself. Currently, I attend the University of the West Indies Mona, Jamaica. Previously, I attended 
            the well known Wolmer's Schools from its Pre-School all the way through its High School for Boys. Since Wolmer's is in Kingston, I spent most of my youth living nearby, in the parish of St. Andrew, which is north of Kingston. 
            Some of my favourite hobbies are playing videogames, listening to music and driving. 
            I am interested in web development as it will help me make websites, which are a great means of gathering and sharing information. 
            It will especially help me in the field of study that I am going into.</p>
